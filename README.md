 Bubble Shooter Game Remake
    - Just for fun, made from scratch

 bubble.java is home of bubble object
 driver.java is where JFrame and JPanels are made, things are instantiated, etc
 mainPanel.java is the main JPanel, paints everything on the main screen (game, buttons, arrow, queue, etc.)
 shooter.java contains information for arrow, and timer + info for projectile
    - object is instantiated in driver.java, then sent to mainPanel.java to be drawn
